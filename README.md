# CS-320-Project
This is for CS 320
  This code was for software test automation. During this project I created contact, contactservice, task, taskservice, appointment, and appointment service as well as tests designed to ensure the code was functional. A long with the code was the writing assignment for project 2 that asked us to discuss the code we created.
 Questions for upload:
 
    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    How do I approach designing software?
    
 Response:
 
During these projects, we were given milestones. The milestones had us create a class and service class. With those classes we used junit to create tests and test the code. While testing the code, I ensured that all tests were passed and that it had a coverage of atleast 80%. This meant the code was functional. To ensure that the code was secure I utilized input validation, as well as encapsulation whenever possible.
I interpreted the user needs by looking at the requirements. The requirements said exactly what the code needed it to do and nothing more and nothing less. This allowed me to approach the solution step by step. As I added code, I would create a test before continuing to the next item. Each part of the system needed its own test and I ensured to check both the class and service class for each milestone both as seperate. What this did was test the integration of the service class didn't break the class.
I approach designing software by look at the requirements first. After looking at the requirements I plan out how it needs to be developed starting with variables then functions/methods needed in order for the software to work. After From there, I implement helper methods in order to reduce redundant code. While implementing these methods I perform tests to make sure they are functional, if they are not functional I then go back and revisit the logic of the code. Once the code is completed test both the coverage and for failures in the code assuring they reach 80% coverage as a minimum.
